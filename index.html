        <div class="def-label">Founding definition</div>
        <div class="def-term">Knowledge Intelligence</div>
        <p class="def-body">The enterprise capability to <strong>identify, measure, and govern</strong> everything an
          organisation knows - across both <strong>explicit</strong> and <strong>tacit</strong> forms - so that knowledge
          becomes <strong>decision-relevant</strong>, <strong>confidence-weighted</strong>, and <strong>continuously
            managed over time</strong> rather than merely stored.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Every organisation runs on knowledge. The decisions that shape its direction, the expertise that defines its
        capability, the memory that holds its history together - all of it is knowledge. And yet no organisation can
        tell you what it knows, how much of it is reliable, where it is concentrated, or how fast it is disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>This is not a technology failure. It is a conceptual one. <strong>Knowledge is not one thing</strong> - it is
        an enormous, varied universe: documents and data, yes, but also the judgement accumulated over decades of
        practice, the institutional memory that lives only in people's heads, the relationships that determine how
        decisions really get made, the patterns only visible to those who have seen enough to recognise them. No
        existing framework accounts for all of this. Most don't try.</p>
      <p>I believe this gap is not incidental. It is the central unsolved problem of the knowledge economy - and the
        reason organisations continue to lose what they know, act on what they merely assume, and make decisions without
        understanding the quality of the knowledge beneath them.</p>
      <p>The capability that closes this gap is <strong>Knowledge Intelligence</strong>: the ability to treat everything
        an organisation knows - in all its forms - as a governed, measurable, and decision-relevant asset. It has no
        established category, no recognised framework, and no dominant platform. This paper is its founding statement.
